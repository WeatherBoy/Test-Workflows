  abstract = {Type 2 diabetes mellitus represents a multi-dimensional challenge for European and global societies alike. Building on an iterative six-step disease management process that leverages feedback loops and utilizes commodity digital tools, the PDM-ProValue study program demonstrated that integrated personalized diabetes management, or iPDM, can improve the standard of care for persons living with diabetes in a sustainable way. The novel “iPDM Goes Europe” consortium strives to advance iPDM adoption by (1) implementing the concept in a value-based healthcare setting for the treatment of persons living with type 2 diabetes, (2) providing tools to assess the patient’s physical and mental health status, and (3) exploring new avenues to take advantage of emerging big data resources.}
