Firstly, I would like to thank the three medical students who took the time to provide counsel and for the interviews, which provided invaluable feedback for this report. Secondly, I would like to sincerely thank my supervisor, Per Bækgaard. I believe his calm attitude, vast knowledge on the subject, and boundless patience to have been the perfect match for my chaotic approach to this last project of my university degree.
